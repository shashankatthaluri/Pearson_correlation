# Pearson Correlation Coefficient App 📊

This simple desktop application allows users to input pairs of coordinates (x, y) and calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to determine the degree of correlation between two datasets.

## Features 🌟

- Add individual data points (x, y) to the dataset.
- Calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient along with other statistical measures.
- Load data from a file (CSV format) for analysis.
- Display results in a tabular output area.
- Bonus: Visualize the data with a scatter plot. 📈
